## 1. The Duplication Tax

The average fintech spends **30% of its burn rate** rebuilding KYC/AML/compliance stacks that are 95% identical. That's **$12 billion per year** wasted on duplicated infrastructure. Finance doesn't need another SaaS dashboard — it needs a protocol, like **SMTP for email** or **HTTP for the web**.

## 2. The Protocol Architecture

- **Core primitive:** Compliance State Machine — a JSON-based, jurisdiction-agnostic rules engine
- **Three endpoints only:** `/verify` (identity), `/attest` (compliance proof), `/settle` (payment)
- **Open-source (Apache 2.0)** — no API keys required for development and testing
